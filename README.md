## For BlueprintUe.h 
Here's a brief explanation of what this code does:

    class FBlueprintReader : public IModuleInterface: This declares a new class FBlueprintReader that inherits from IModuleInterface. The IModuleInterface class is a base class for Unreal Engine modules.

    void ReadBlueprint(): This declares a function that will be used to read Blueprints from the Unreal Engine project.

    void RegisterMenus(), void RegisterSettings(), void UnregisterSettings(), bool HandleSettingsSaved(): These functions are used to manage the plugin's settings and menus. They are similar to the corresponding functions in the BlueprintUe.h file.

    TSharedRef<class SDockTab> OnSpawnPluginTab(const class FSpawnTabArgs& SpawnTabArgs): This function is used to create a new tab in Unreal Engine's editor when the plugin is activated.

    TSharedPtr<class FUICommandList> PluginCommands: This data member is used to store the plugin's commands. These commands can be used to interact with the plugin in Unreal Engine's editor.

Please note that this is a basic design and might need to be adjusted based on your specific needs and the actual implementation of the BlueprintReader class.
